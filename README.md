# Trams

A bunch of trams and tram related stuff I'm designing.

## Overview
- `README.md` = overview of everything
- `trams.md` = specifications of each model

## Trams
- Milcov-1   - original, something to get started, inspired by Bucur LF
- Milcov-2\* - high-floor version of Milcov-1 for sligthly higher capacity
- Milcov-5\* - expanded version of Milcov-1 with 5 wagons
- Letca\*    - smaller tram, only 1 wagon, meant for low-demand routes

\* - non yet designed
